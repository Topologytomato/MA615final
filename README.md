# What is this?
This is final project about MA615 FALL 2022 MSSP. The main ideal is about explore data in MBTA archive(https://cdn.mbta.com/archive/archived_feeds.txt) MBTA open data portal(https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/),a EDA report is generated, and a shiny app is built to show the results.

# Data used
Data file used is too large, so the data_clean.R is a script to generate and clean, filter the data we want.
However, the data used is still larger than 2GB, which makes it impossible to update all data. Data used is uploaded through blackboard.
